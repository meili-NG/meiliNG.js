## Getting Started
Hello, Welcome to meiliNG, an oAuth2 based authentication engine to build your customized login in no time.

## Installing Dependenices
### Installing Node
meiliNG works best with latest LTS version of Node, Please go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install it by yourself.

### Installing Yarn
meiliNG uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for managing dependencies of application.  

> **Note**  
> Currently Yarn 1.x is preferred due to compatibility issues. 

### Installing node_modules
meiliNG does depend on lots of packages on npmjs.org which does not come out of box.  
Please install node dependencies with `yarn` command.  

### (Optional) Generate Prisma Definition Files
On postinstall of node_modules or any updates, `yarn` should automatically generate prisma definition files. you can generate prisma definition files via `prisma`'s internal commands.  

Please run `yarn generate` if the prisma definition files are not properly generated.  

## Configuring Environment Variables
meiliNG comes with various config methods.  
You can use [sample .env file (.env.example)](/.env.example) shipped with this repository. In order to use it, just copy `.env.example` to `.env`

## Setting up Database

### Setting up MariaDB (or mySQL)
meiliNG uses [prisma](https://prisma.io), a next-generation ORM for Node.JS.
Install MariaDB or mySQL depending on your platform.

### Setting Database URL
Prisma by default uses environment variables to get URL for connecting database. In order to configure database, you should configure database credentials into URL form.  

You should set environment variable `DATABASE_URL` or edit [`.env` file](/.env) to following:
* MySQL/MariaDB: `mysql://username:password@host:port/database`

<!--
* PostgreSQL: `postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?schema=public`
* Microsoft SQL Server, mongoDB: Please refer to [Prisma: Getting Started with Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/preview-features/sql-server/sql-server-start-from-scratch-typescript#connect-your-database)
-->

### Setting up automatically

Run `yarn configure` and follow the directions on screen.
